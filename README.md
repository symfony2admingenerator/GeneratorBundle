## 1. Quick tour:

This bundle helps you quickly create powerful CRUD backend. Customizing the standard functionalities is simple - you can easily overwrite any part of the generated code. Most features can be configured in one (per model) YAML file. Advanced examples are covered in our [Cookbook][cookbook]. For a quick preview visit our [demo project][s2a-demo].

## 2. Highlights:

* one command to generate full CRUD for a model
* one configuration file (per model) to customize your backend
* supports popular model managers: **Doctrine ORM**, **Doctrine ODM** and **Propel**
* admin design based on [AdminLTE v2](https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE)
* active community, support on [Gitter Chat][gitter-chat]

# 5. Versioning

Releases will be numbered with the format `major.minor.patch`.

And constructed with the following guidelines.

* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major.
* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor.
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch.

For more information on SemVer, please visit [semver.org][semver] website.

# 5. Contributing

This bundle follows branching model described in [A successful git branching model][branching-model-post] blog post by Vincent Driessen.

* The `master` branch is used to tag stable releases.
* The `develop` branch is used to develop small changes and merge feature branches into it.
* The `feature-` branches are used to develop features. When ready, submit a PR to `develop` branch.
* The `hotfixes` branch is used to develop fixes to severe bugs in stable releases. When ready, the fix is merged both to `develop` and `master` branches.
* The release branches (eg. `1.1`) are created for each minor release and only patches will be merged into them.
