# Documentation
---------------------------------------
This site provides API documentation for latest build of Symfony2 Admin Generator. If you're working with older versions 
we encourage you to update to latest build. If you're getting errors or have trouble with updating see 
[submitting issues][support-issues] and open a ticket on github.

**Watch out!** When using this bundle on Symfony 4 or above, you need to update your frontend controller
and console binary to load the `AdminGenerated` namespace. If you do not do this, you will see that 
the cache is never working when debug is enabled!
